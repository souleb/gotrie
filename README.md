# gotrie

Gotrie is a [radix tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree) implementation in Go.

The API is designed after [pygtrie](https://github.com/google/pygtrie) as I needed
a similar library in Go.

It's not as feature complete as pygtrie, but it's a start.

There is an example in the `example` directory that shows how to use the library.
